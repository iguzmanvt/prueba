# Mexico's Long-Term Economic Growth and Investment Attractiveness

In the long run, the determinants of Mexico's economic growth are shaped by the strength of its domestic market. The key lies in making Mexico a highly attractive economy for investment and talent deployment, and for Mexicans themselves, both those within the country and those residing abroad, to freely choose to invest and work in Mexico.

The return on investment corresponds to the difference between sales levels and input costs. Therefore, to improve it, efforts should be directed towards increasing the value of sales or reducing production costs. Increasing sales can be achieved by adding more value to the goods and services produced. Greater efficiency in strategic precursor sectors, such as infrastructure, telecommunications, and energy, allows companies to reduce their costs. The government's role is fundamental in improving the efficiency of these strategic sectors and establishing market conditions that reduce risk: ensuring the rule of law, guaranteeing public and legal security, and eradicating corruption.

Reducing investment risk allows for lowering the expected return for investors without affecting the attractiveness of investments. On the contrary, investors will be willing to accept lower returns as their returns will result from innovation, competitiveness, and business efficiency.

Combating corruption, labor reform, and rationalizing current public spending are necessary measures to steer the economy in the right direction. An important part of Mexico's attractiveness will depend on significantly reducing corruption and impunity, on better and greater protection of labor rights, and on maintaining a fiscal policy that is not only stable and prudent but also correctly allocates spending and resources.

## Key Elements Driving Mexico's Long-Term Growth

- **Employment and Business Dynamics**: According to the Economic Census of 2019, employment growth outpaced the growth in the number of enterprises, indicating a trend towards fewer but slightly larger firms. This trend suggests a consolidation in the business sector, potentially leading to increased efficiency and productivity.

- **Robust Value Added Growth**: Robust growth in value added across most sectors is anticipated, supported by several key indicators:
  1. Increase in real formal payrolls
  2. Positive profit reports from publicly traded companies
  3. Substantial and steady rise in corporate income tax revenue, indicating sustained growth in the taxable base
  
  These factors collectively point to a strengthening economic foundation across various sectors and regions.

- **Economic Environment Favorable to MSMEs**: A favorable economic environment for the investment and growth of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) is crucial for domestic market growth. According to INEGI's Economic Censuses, the increase in the added value of these sectors is significant in the 2019 measurement.

Establishing an investment environment that reduces costs and controls risk levels is particularly important for MSMEs, especially in the regions and economic sectors that have historically faced the greatest difficulties in participating in the modern economy. The positive impact of their incorporation would affect not only growth but also income distribution, labor market dynamism, and the strength of the domestic market.

- **Formal Job Creation**: As previously shown in Graph VII, the net creation of formal jobs in the private sector (IMSS affiliates) has been very large in recent years, although the growth trend in formal employment has slowed in 2024. The average annual growth rate for 2023 was above the average observed for the 2010-2018 period.

- **Real Wage Recovery**: Graph VII also shows notable growth in real wages, averaging an annual growth rate of more than 5.0% since 2021. This increase is explained by productivity gains and the correction of the minimum wage. Maintaining this recovery is key to strengthening the domestic market.

- **Implementation of Social Programs and Welfare Networks**: Effective implementation of social programs, based on direct transfer schemes, will boost the domestic market. Programs like "JÃ³venes Construyendo el Futuro" will improve consumption opportunities for new segments and beneficiaries who receive more direct financial support.

- **Reactivation of the Construction Sector**: The construction subsector has recovered significantly, as shown in Graph III. A thriving construction industry is fundamental to revitalize the domestic market, as many workers in this industry work on an eventual basis and face greater vulnerability.

- **Recovery and Increase in Investment Flows**: The recovery of investment must be of a more than proportional nature so that investment as a percentage of GDP continues with a coefficient close to 25%, as shown in Graph IV.

- **Demographic Structure**: The proportional decrease in the labor force will generate difficulties for economies with aging problems. The aging of the world population constitutes an advantage for Mexico due to its relatively younger demographic. This youthfulness will enhance labor competitiveness and reduce public spending pressures.

- **Technological Change**: Advances in AI and robotics will reshape the labor market. Mexico must adapt by investing in innovation, technical and engineering education, and sectors like aeronautics, auto parts, medical devices, electronics, software, and agribusiness to build a competitive position in the global digital economy.

## Conclusion

To consolidate Mexico as a highly attractive country for investment, it is necessary to make the public sector more efficient through actions such as improving the functioning of the IMSS, increasing institutional efficiency, eliminating intermediaries in direct support, and combating corruption and impunity. The government's early actions have focused on these areas.

In summary, Mexico's long-term economic growth and investment attractiveness hinge on strengthening its domestic market, creating a favorable environment for MSMEs, continuing formal job creation and real wage recovery, effectively implementing social programs, revitalizing strategic sectors like construction, boosting investment flows, capitalizing on its demographic advantage, and adapting to technological changes. By focusing on these key areas and enacting necessary reforms, Mexico can position itself as a highly competitive destination for global investment and talent.
