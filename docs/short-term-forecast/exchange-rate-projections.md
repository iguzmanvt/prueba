# Exchange Rate Projections

The exchange rate projections show some variability among the agencies. For 2024, CMM forecasts an exchange rate of 19.0 pesos per USD, which is slightly higher than the projections from Banxico expert evaluation, SHCP, and Citibanamex, which estimate around 17.8-17.9 pesos per USD. For 2025, CMM maintains its forecast at 19.0, while other forecasts suggest a slightly lower range of 18.0-18.8 pesos per USD, indicating expectations of a stable or modestly appreciating peso.

Since the Federal Reserve (Fed) raised interest rates in December 2015, the Bank of Mexico (Banxico) has aligned its monetary policy direction with that of the Fed. However, the significant depreciation of the peso in 2015 led Banxico to adopt more restrictive measures to prevent the devaluation from translating into higher inflation rates. This policy helped stabilize the peso, although it experienced another sharp depreciation in 2016 due to the U.S. presidential election and Trump's victory.

This policy resulted in a widening interest rate differential, making carry-trade operations attractive, with levels between $100 billion and $120 billion in 2019 compared to $20 billion in 2009. Among investment-grade countries, Mexico has the largest interest rate gap relative to the United States.

During the post-pandemic period, the peso has performed exceptionally well compared to other global currencies. This is attributed to the interest rate differential with the United States, supported by Banxico's proactive rate hikes before those of developed countries. Despite increased borrowing, Mexico's public finances still hold a good reputation among investors due to favorable credit ratings from major rating agencies and the inflow of investment driven by nearshoring. Additionally, expectations that the Fed will delay normalizing its monetary policy and the Mexican government's commitment to sound public finances under López Obrador have made Mexico attractive to international financial investors.

## Exchange Rate Long-Term Estimates

The exchange rate is forecasted to remain anchored at 19.0 pesos per USD. However, this variable exhibits the most variability in the medium term, in line with expert consensus. In the short term, the exchange rate is influenced predominantly by the differential between the reference rates of Mexico and the United States. In the medium term, factors such as confidence in Mexico's ability to continue servicing its public debt at high-interest rates, the existence of autonomous institutions, and the maintenance of the USMCA will be crucial.

The relative strength of the peso in recent years is linked to market appreciation of Mexico's fiscal discipline and the interest rate differential. However, this stability is threatened by Pemex's financial weaknesses, an inadequate business plan implementation, and potential impacts on its investment grade and sovereign debt rating.

Banxico cannot lower the reference rate until inflation is within its monetary policy target (below 4%) and country risk is reduced. Lowering the rate prematurely could trigger capital outflows, causing a devaluation that could negatively affect inflation expectations. To sustainably reduce the interest rate gap without risking inflation, Mexico needs to enhance its attractiveness for real economy investments and improve growth expectations. Key conditions include:

- Reducing corruption and extortion practices, especially for SMEs.
- Recovering purchasing power and wages.
- Developing a robust domestic market.
- Resolving obstacles to major investment projects, such as land acquisition and administrative hurdles.
- Strengthening institutional capacity.
- Efficiently executing government infrastructure spending.
- Providing clear policy certainty.
- Respecting contracts.
- Increasing export participation in the U.S. market, partly driven by tensions with China.

These improvements could change investor expectations, leading to a better peso valuation against the dollar and allowing for a gradual and non-disruptive interest rate reduction.

Without a notable increase in investment attractiveness, the interest rate differential could harm the economy, which relies on short-term financial investors' confidence in the government's fiscal program and measures to improve Pemex's financial situation. This confidence is vulnerable to sudden internal or external events. The worst-case scenario for Mexico would be pressure on the peso coinciding with a U.S. economic slowdown, highlighting the need to strengthen the national economy's foundations.

## Monetary Policy and Inflation Dynamics

Banxico has maintained a restrictive monetary policy stance since August 2022, with the target interest rate reaching 8.50% and the ex-ante real interest rate, which determines the level of monetary restriction, standing at 3.55%, exceeding the upper range of the central bank's estimates for the neutral interest rate (1.80% to 3.40%).

Banxico's Governing Board raised the nominal rate to 11.25% on March 30, 2023, and maintained it at that level until March 21, 2024, when it cut the interest rate by 25 basis points to 11.00%. Although the nominal interest rate remained unchanged for nearly a year, the gradual decrease in 12-month inflation expectations allowed the ex-ante real rate to rise to a maximum of 7.21% in January 2024. However, with the recent 25 basis point interest rate cut and due to a moderate rebound in long-term inflation expectations, the ex-ante real rate fell to 6.81% in March, implying a slightly less restrictive monetary policy compared to the beginning of the year.

The outlook for monetary policy in Mexico is complex, with both potential for a less restrictive stance due to economic slowdown and accumulated risks that may push inflation upward. Internal risks include the persistence of services inflation, high projected budget deficit, potential depreciation of the peso, pressures on non-core inflation, and recent tariffs on imported products. External risks encompass increased transportation costs, possible stagnation of U.S. inflation, and the possibility of new supply shocks, particularly related to the conflict in the Middle East.

## Monetary Policy Outlook

The market maintains the expectation that Banxico's Governing Board will continue to make rate cuts in 2024, based on the central bank's own forecast, which points to inflation of 3.6% in Q4 2024 and 3.2% in Q1 2025. However, the stagnation of inflation over the last six months makes it unlikely that it will fall below 4.0% by the end of the year.

The behavior of the exchange rate is also relevant, as the high interest rate, especially due to the wide differential it maintains with respect to the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate, encourages the entry of foreign capital into the country. This has led to the exchange rate being located below its level considered to be in equilibrium, presenting a high vulnerability to a rebound, which could end up generating greater inflationary pressures.

Banxico must carefully navigate this situation, avoiding maintaining interest rates at levels that excessively encourage capital inflows and appreciate the peso, while also refraining from lowering rates too quickly, as this could send the wrong signal to the market and lead to increased inflation and accelerated depreciation of the peso.

In its latest monetary policy decision, Banxico's minutes indicate that its members consider the balance of risks to remain biased to the upside. All Board members acknowledged the reduction in core inflation, while the majority pointed out that recent increases in inflation respond to the non-core component. The majority also highlighted the contrast between merchandise inflation, which has decreased steadily, and the services component, which remains elevated and shows no clear turning point downward.

Inflation projections were revised upward, with the effects of inflationary shocks expected to take longer to dissipate. According to updated estimates, inflation will reach its 3.0% target in Q4 2025, compared to the previous estimate of Q2 2025. Most members agreed that, despite progress in reducing inflation, the balance of risks remains biased to the upside, with the main upside risks related to the persistence of services inflation. Additionally, some members pointed out the risk of non-core inflation being higher than forecast.

The Board's discussion suggests a 25bp cut in June, with a 3-2 vote. The restrictive positions of two members make the June decision a close call. As the inflation outlook improves and the Fed begins its rate-cutting cycle, Banxico would have room to make continuous cuts and potentially accelerate the pace to 50bp in the November and December decisions.

CMM maintains the expectation of three additional interest rate cuts in 2024, with the rate reaching 10.00% by the end of the year, subject to inflation not rebounding and remaining below 4.5% towards the end of the year. However, if an uptick in inflation is observed, the Governing Board may choose to keep the interest rate unchanged for a longer period and implement only 1 or 2 more cuts of 25 basis points each.
