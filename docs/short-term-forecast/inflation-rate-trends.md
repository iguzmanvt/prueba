# Inflation Rate Trends

## Short-Term Inflation

Inflation remains a pressing concern in Mexico, with most forecasts predicting a gradual decline from current elevated levels. According to CMM, headline inflation is projected to reach 4.3% in 2023, while Banxico's Quarterly Report anticipates a slightly lower rate of 3.5%. In 2024, inflation is expected to further decrease to 3.3% as per CMM's projections, aligning closely with forecasts from Banxico experts, SHCP, Citibanamex, and the IMF, which hover around the mid-3% range. Core inflation is also expected to stabilize, with CMM projecting 4.5% for 2023, slightly higher than other forecasts.

Recent data from INEGI shows that Mexico's general inflation rate stood at 4.8% annually in the first half of May 2024, accelerating from 4.7% in the second half of April and marking the highest annual rate since the second half of January this year at 4.9%.

To determine the presence of inflationary pressures that could raise long-term inflation, it is essential to observe which component is increasing, as it might indicate either a transient spike or a more persistent trend. Core inflation in Mexico, which encompasses the prices of more stable products and is considered the fundamental inflation rate of the economy, provides a medium- and long-term inflation trajectory. It has shown a more stable downward trend but remains elevated above the Bank of Mexico's 3% annual target. In July 2024, core inflation stood at 4.0% annually. The decrease in core inflation can be attributed to the slowdown in merchandise inflation, which registered an annual rate of 3.55% in the first half of May, the lowest since the first half of December 2019 (3.55%). Both food and non-food merchandise showed annual slowdowns, settling at 4.61% and 2.29%, respectively.

Non-core annual inflation, which includes more volatile prices and government-regulated tariffs, increased from 0.10% to 1.79% between the third and fourth quarters of 2023, reaching 3.93% in the first half of February 2024. Banxico's heat map of inflation risks indicates that while several inflationary pressures continue to ease, some remain relevant.

According to Banxico's latest Quarterly Report, merchandise inflation has been declining for fourteen consecutive months as of January 2024. This trend is attributed to the dissipating effects of shocks derived from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, as well as lower levels of the exchange rate compared to those observed at the beginning of 2023. However, services inflation has remained elevated and continues to show no clear downward trend, affected by pressures related to operating costs and their pass-through to consumer prices amid the recovery of demand following the lockdown.

## Long-Term Inflation Outlook

CMM projects that inflation in Mexico will stabilize at around 3.5%, a target expected to be reached by the end of 2025 or the beginning of 2026. This projection aligns closely with Banxico experts, who forecast inflation at 3.6%, and is slightly higher than the IMF's projection of 3.0%.

Several factors influence the movements of long-term inflation. High interest rates impact merchandise inflation, while the slowdown in the services component affects underlying inflation. Additionally, external factors such as wars and droughts have notable effects on non-core inflation components, particularly energy and livestock prices.

On the demand side, the indicator related to the cyclical position of the economy maintains an orange color, suggesting potential inflationary pressures, while indicators for international economic activity and the national current account do not suggest significant risks. On the supply side, weather factors and wage pressures are currently the most relevant risks to inflation, according to the dashboard and from a historical behavior perspective. In contrast, factors that previously exerted significant pressure on inflation, such as international references, logistical problems, input costs, and global inflation, currently represent relatively low levels of risk. The exchange rate also continues to not constitute a relevant risk to inflation in relation to its historical behavior.

While the annual inflation rate for merchandise has shown a marked deceleration since late 2022, recent fortnightly behavior has been mixed, indicating a potential slight rebound or a slowdown in its deceleration. Inflationary pressures in the services sector continue to persist, and energy price figures should be interpreted with caution, as significant declines in some fortnights of 2024 have not been sufficient to counteract increases observed last year.

## Monetary Policy Divergence Analysis

Mexico's interest rate dynamics present a complex interplay of domestic and international factors, with significant implications for the country's economic stability and growth prospects. Among countries with an investment grade, Mexico maintains the largest interest rate gap with the United States, a key factor in its attractiveness to international financial investors.

As mentioned in section 1.1 of this document, among countries with an investment grade, Mexico has the largest interest rate gap with the United States. The substantial interest rate differential between Mexico and the U.S. has been a double-edged sword for the Mexican economy:

- **Attractiveness to Investors**: The high rates have made Mexico highly attractive to international financial investors, supporting capital inflows and peso strength.
- **Fiscal and Economic Costs**: However, this differential imposes high costs on public finances and debtor investors in Mexico, while also reducing profit margins for exporting sectors and those competing with dollar-denominated imports.
- **Monetary Policy Constraints**: Banxico faces constraints in lowering the reference rate until inflation is consistently within its target range (below 4%) and country risk is reduced. Premature rate cuts could trigger capital outflows and peso devaluation, affecting inflation expectations.

The relative strength of the peso during 2023 and 2024—related to fiscal discipline and the interest rate differential—is nevertheless threatened by Pemex's financial weakness, critical assessments of its business plan implementation, and the impact this may have on its investment grade and sovereign debt.

In an ideal scenario, a significant increase in the country's competitiveness, in the sense of improving growth prospects, would require the following conditions:

- Reducing corruption and extortion practices
- Recovering purchasing power and wages
- Stimulating the domestic market
- Resolving obstacles to large investment projects
- Strengthening institutions and government execution capacity
- Providing policy certainty
- Reforming justice and security institutions
- Modernizing the financial system
- Expanding export participation in the U.S. market

The above would translate into a change in real sector investors' expectations, resulting in a better peso-dollar exchange rate and leading to a sustainable and more ambitious reduction of the reference interest rate, narrowing the gap. The mere possibility of a peso revaluation would allow for a safe, gradual, and non-disruptive rate reduction.
