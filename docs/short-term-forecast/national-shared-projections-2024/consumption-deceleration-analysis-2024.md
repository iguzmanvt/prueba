# Consumption Deceleration Analysis for 2024

In 2023, consumption growth in Mexico reached 4.2%, surpassing the pre-pandemic (2013-2019) average of 2.0%. This increase aligns with positive trends in retail trade and services indicators. The rise in consumption is directly attributed to an increase in personal disposable income. However, the sustainability of this growth trajectory is now in question.

Key factors influencing consumption growth:

1. **Real Wage Increases**: The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) data shows that the base contribution wage increased by an average of 5.2% in real terms annually in 2023, higher than the 2.7% average for 2019-2022. This effect is particularly pronounced in transformation industries linked to manufacturing, especially in the central and northern regions of the country. This trend suggests that investment increases in these areas are based on productivity gains and have the potential to be sustained in the medium term.

2. **Minimum Wage Impact**: Minimum wage increases account for about 20% of annual wage increases since 2016. While these increases are expected to continue in the coming years, their magnitude is likely to diminish due to growing cost pressures and the risk of increasing unemployment. Additionally, minimum wage increases will become less necessary as Mexico closes the gap with benchmarks in other Latin American countries.

3. **Remittances**: Remittance inflows reached record levels, driven by increased money supply in the United States due to government transfer programs during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the peso's appreciation actually reduced the purchasing power of these remittances by 5.0% over the year.

### Factors Contributing to Expected Consumption Deceleration in 2024

1. **Employment Growth Slowdown**: IMSS employment data for May 2024 indicates a smaller increase compared to the 2023 average, reflecting this year's economic tightening and the real wage increases over the past three years.

2. **Government Transfer Timing**: The advancement of government transfers from social programs due to the federal election in Mexico in the first two months of the year is expected to boost consumption in Q1. However, if beneficiaries don't adequately distribute these resources during the electoral ban, it could lead to less personal disposable income during April and May. Normal payment scheduling resumed in June after the elections.

3. **U.S. Economic Slowdown and Remittances**: The anticipated slowdown in the United States, coupled with the cessation of U.S. government transfers, is expected to affect dollar remittance receipts. CMM projects that, combining these two effects, remittances will fall by an average of 2.7% in 2024.

4. **Credit Consumption Moderation**: While the increase in income, along with credit yields resulting from high interest rates, has led to an increase in the consumption component of the current credit portfolio to the private sector (as reported by Banco de MÃ©xico), this growth has been moderating in the last months of 2023. This moderation is due to both a reduction in new consumer loans or credit cards and an increase in non-performing loans in this component, which could imply an eventual slowdown in aggregate consumption.

These projections reflect a nuanced view of consumption trends, acknowledging the continued strength of underlying factors while recognizing the emerging headwinds that are likely to moderate growth as 2024 progresses. The interplay between wage growth, remittances, credit conditions, and broader economic factors will be an important element to determine the exact trajectory of consumption in the coming year.
