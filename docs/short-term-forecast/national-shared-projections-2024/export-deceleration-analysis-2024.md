# Export Deceleration Analysis for 2024

Net exports in Mexico were negative in 2023, primarily due to decreased demand for global goods from the United States. The deceleration in exports has been significant, with nominal growth of 4.9% in 2023, which, although positive, is substantially lower than the 19% growth observed in the previous year. This slowdown was sufficient to cause a decline in manufacturing production within secondary activities, from 2.6% in the first quarter of 2023 to -0.1% in the fourth quarter.

### Key Factors Influencing Export Trends

1. **U.S. Import Dynamics**: Despite the overall decline, the reduction in U.S. imports of Mexican goods (average per month) was not as severe as the reduction in total goods imports (-4.9%). This was largely due to a significant decrease in Chinese imports, which fell by an average of 19.8% per month.

2. **Mexico's Improved Trade Position**: Mexico capitalized on this situation and became the primary source of imports for the United States (in terms of percentage of total imports by country), a position China had held since 2009.

3. **Sector-Specific Performance**: U.S. import data shows an annualized quarterly increase of 1.9%. This growth was primarily driven by imports of computers and related parts (58.2% annualized quarterly growth in Q4 2023), while the automotive and auto parts sector experienced a 4.2% reduction.

4. **Shift in Import Sources**: The percentage of imports of machinery related to computer equipment and electronics from Mexico saw a significant increase from 2022 to 2023, coinciding with a substantial reduction in China's share in these products. In contrast, Mexico's imports in the automotive and auto parts sector remained relatively stable over the last five years, while imports of these products from China saw a notable reduction in 2023 (from 5.5% to 4.1%).

### Factors Contributing to Expected Export Deceleration in 2024

1. **U.S. Market Dependence**: Given the importance of the U.S. domestic market for Mexican manufacturing exports, the effects of a slowdown in 2024 will impact production in Mexico in the short term.

2. **Trade Partner Status**: While Mexico has consolidated its position as the United States' main trading partner during this period, a continued decline in imports could pose economic challenges for Mexico in the short to medium term.

3. **Global Economic Conditions**: The overall slowdown in global trade and potential recessionary pressures in major economies could further dampen demand for Mexican exports.

4. **Sector Vulnerabilities**: The automotive sector, traditionally a strong component of Mexican exports, shows signs of weakness. This could offset gains in other sectors like electronics and computer parts.

### Export Growth Projection

Considering these factors, our estimate for exports is that they will halt the abrupt fall experienced in 2023 but will have growth close to zero on average for the year. This projection reflects a complex interplay of factors:

1. The stabilization of Mexico's position as a key U.S. trade partner may provide a buffer against more severe declines.

2. Growth in certain sectors (like electronics) may partially offset declines in others (like automotive).

3. The overall slowdown in global trade and potential U.S. economic deceleration will continue to exert downward pressure on export growth.

The near-zero growth projection for exports in 2024 represents a significant shift from the robust growth seen in previous years and underscores the challenges facing Mexico's export-oriented sectors. It highlights the need for diversification in both export markets and product categories to mitigate risks associated with overreliance on specific sectors or trading partners.

The export outlook for 2024 thus presents a picture of stabilization rather than growth, with Mexico navigating a complex global trade environment characterized by shifting supply chains, evolving sector dynamics, and broader economic uncertainties.
