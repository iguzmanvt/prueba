# Investment Deceleration Analysis for 2024

As outlined in section 1.1 of this document, Nearshoring has been the primary driver of growth in Mexico's investment landscape in 2023, with gross fixed investment increasing by nearly 20% on average. This growth rate surpasses even the levels seen during the 1996-1998 period following the implementation of NAFTA. However, the sustainability of this growth trajectory is now in question.

Breaking down the investment components, both machinery and equipment and construction saw similar increases of 19.9% and 20.6% respectively. When weighted by their share in total investment, the machinery and equipment component emerges as the primary contributor to growth. This expansion is predominantly driven by the private sector, as evidenced by the growth in foreign direct investment and capital goods imports, both averaging around 20% for the year.

For 2024, we anticipate that investment growth will continue at high rates, primarily due to the sustained momentum in capital goods imports. As these goods form the basis of fixed capital formation, their installation process is expected to generate an increase in this indicator throughout 2024. This trend is illustrated in Graph V, which shows the import of capital goods in Mexico from 2012 to 2023, indexed to 2012=100 and presented as annual percentage changes.

However, it's important to note that while these anticipated investment growth rates remain attractive, they are expected to be lower than current levels. This deceleration is attributed to several factors:

1. **U.S. Economic Slowdown**: The anticipated economic deceleration in the United States is expected to limit investment expansion during the second half of 2024. Given the close economic ties between the two countries, a slowdown in U.S. demand could dampen investment enthusiasm in Mexico.
2. **Electoral Periods**: In 2024, both Mexico and the United States will undergo significant electoral processes, with Mexico's already concluded and the United States' about to begin. Historically, investors tend to adopt a wait-and-see approach during such periods, preferring to await election outcomes before making significant investment decisions. This cautious stance could contribute to a slowdown in investment growth.
3. **Recent Deceleration Trends**: The last quarter of 2023 already showed signs of deceleration in both capital goods imports and gross fixed capital formation. This trend suggests that while the positive effects of nearshoring are expected to continue, investment growth rates are likely to experience a slowdown in 2024.

Short-term considerations for this GDP component include the duration of the Q4 deceleration and the extent to which public investment will slow down after the elections, given the new administration taking office in the second half of the year.

In the medium to long term, a significant concern is the potential modification of North American integration dynamics resulting from the U.S. presidential and congressional election outcomes. These changes could range from the imposition of tariffs to alterations in USMCA dynamics and rules, potentially affecting investment patterns and economic integration between Mexico and the United States.

The investment landscape in Mexico for 2024 thus presents a complex picture of continued growth, albeit at a decelerating pace, influenced by both domestic and international factors. While nearshoring continues to provide a strong foundation for investment, external economic conditions and political uncertainties pose challenges to maintaining the high growth rates observed in 2023.
