# National Shared Projections for 2025

For 2025, we project Mexico's economy to grow by 1.8%, aligning with forecasts from other agencies. This growth rate reflects a stabilization of various economic factors, including export policies benefiting from initial nearshoring initiatives, along with a moderation in investment and consumption growth rates. Table IV provides a detailed quarterly breakdown of the projected changes in real GDP growth and its components for Mexico in 2025:

### Key Observations from the Projections

- **GDP Growth**: The economy is expected to show a gradual acceleration throughout the year, from 1.1% YoY in Q1 to 2.6% in Q4. The quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) growth shows some volatility, with the strongest growth in Q3 (1.7%) and a slight contraction in Q1 (-0.3%).

- **Private Consumption**: This component shows steady growth throughout the year, from 2.2% YoY in Q1 to 3% in Q4, reflecting a stabilization of consumer spending patterns.

- **Government Consumption**: Projections indicate significant volatility, with contractions in the first half of the year followed by expansions in the second half, possibly reflecting fiscal policy adjustments post-election year.

- **Gross Fixed Capital Formation**: While showing positive growth, it decelerates throughout the year, from 2% YoY in Q1 to 1% in Q4, potentially due to a normalization of investment patterns after the initial nearshoring boost.

- **Exports and Imports**: Both show steady growth throughout the year, with exports projected to grow from 2.5% YoY in Q1 to 4% in Q4, and imports from 3% to 4%, reflecting the stabilization of trade flows and the initial benefits of nearshoring initiatives.

### The 1.8% Average GDP Growth Projection for 2025 is Underpinned by Several Factors:

- **Nearshoring Benefits**: The initial positive impacts of nearshoring initiatives are expected to stabilize export growth, contributing to the overall economic expansion.

- **Investment Stabilization**: After the rapid growth seen in previous years, investment growth is projected to moderate but remain positive, averaging 1.5% for the year.

- **Consumption Patterns**: Private consumption is expected to maintain steady growth, averaging 2.6% for the year, reflecting a stabilization of consumer confidence and spending habits.

- **Export Recovery**: The export sector is projected to show consistent growth, averaging 3.5% for the year, benefiting from the established nearshoring trends and potentially improved global economic conditions.

- **Balanced Growth**: The projections suggest a more balanced growth pattern across different sectors of the economy, with less volatility compared to previous years.

This forecast aligns with projections from other agencies, reflecting a consensus view of Mexico's economic trajectory in 2025. The stabilization of growth rates across various components suggests a maturing of the economic recovery and the initial benefits of structural changes such as nearshoring initiatives.

However, it's important to note that these projections are subject to various external and internal factors, including global economic conditions, the success of nearshoring initiatives, domestic policy decisions, and potential geopolitical developments. The gradual acceleration of growth throughout the year also suggests potential for upside surprises if favorable conditions persist or improve.
