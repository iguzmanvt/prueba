# I. Introduction

Mexico stands at a critical juncture in defining its long-term economic trajectory. Over recent decades, the country has faced numerous challenges that have significantly influenced its development. Despite policies implemented to stabilize the economy following the 1995 crisis, growth has been uneven and often insufficient. Economic disparities between regions, productive sectors, and population segments have perpetuated an unequal development trend, affecting both social cohesion and growth potential.

The current global economic landscape, characterized by high complexity in many geographies, presents both risks and opportunities for Mexico. Internally, the country's recent government possesses significant political capital, offering a unique window of opportunity to implement structural reforms that could transform Mexico into a magnet for productive investment.

In this context, in the next decade it would be beneficial for Mexico to configure a sustainable economic development model that is both inclusive and highly competitive. The key lies in making Mexico's economy highly attractive for investment and talent deployment. This not only involves improving conditions for foreign direct investment but also fostering an environment where Mexicans themselves, both those residing in the country and abroad, freely choose to invest and work in their homeland.

Mexico's economic growth has historically been underestimated. As showed in the chapter 1.2 of this document, figures published by international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) typically indicate GDP growth around 2%. However, according to data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), the GDP level is corrected every five years, showing an average real growth of 3.4% over the last 30 years. These periodic corrections, based on more recent input-output tables, reveal a more robust economy than initial figures indicate, underscoring the importance of considering both growth rates and absolute GDP levels for an accurate assessment of economic performance.

Regional and sectoral disparities are evident: while some areas of the country, such as the northeast and north-central regions, have experienced significant growth due to industrialization and foreign investment, other regions, especially in the south and southeast, continue to lag behind. This inequality is reflected in socioeconomic indicators such as per capita income, employment rate, and access to basic services.

Despite these corrections, significant challenges persist. Inequality, insufficient generation of decent jobs, corruption, and high levels of insecurity remain serious problems that deteriorate social morale. Violence and crime, exacerbated by impunity, affect not only citizens' quality of life but also the perception of Mexico as a safe and viable destination for investment.

Moreover, conditions of social backwardness, such as low labor participation and lower wage levels for women, poverty (especially in rural areas), and limited access to financial and social security systems, are structural challenges that must be addressed to achieve sustainable development. The lag in female labor participation and the gender wage gap are particularly concerning, as they limit the potential for economic growth and perpetuate inequality. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive strategy that combines effective public policies, investments in infrastructure and education, and structural reforms that promote transparency and accountability. Only then can Mexico achieve inclusive and sustainable economic development that benefits all its citizens.

This document aims to provide a comprehensive and detailed vision of why investing in Mexico makes economic sense, focusing on the evolution of GDP at both national and regional levels and how this translates into investment and development opportunities. This analysis will extend to the long run, offering a long-term perspective that allows investors to make informed decisions.

Through an analysis of macroeconomic trends, regional dynamics, and key sectors of the economy, this document seeks to delineate a path towards sustainable and inclusive economic growth. It will consolidate various perspectives and forecasts on the Mexican economy, providing a consensual vision of long-term economic development. The document will explain discrepancies between Mexico's real GDP growth and published series, offer an overview of national macroeconomic metric trends in the short and long run, provide a detailed vision of GDP growth by sector and key region, explain relevant regional dynamics and specificities, and include a brief characterization of the economy of each of Mexico's regions.
